This is a project completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) Javascript Curriculum.

This project implements a script which dynamically renders an application allowing you to create Projects, each containing there own tasks. Rendering tasks and projects, as well as the adding, deleting and edit tasks and projects are each separated into its own javascript module.

Dependencies can be installed by running `npm install` if node.js is installed.

To get started, clone the repo and run 'dist/index.html' in a browser.
